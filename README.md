# MUDConformanceTest
This repositroy hosts Conformance Test Specifications for the MUD standard. This document maps the IETF MUD standard specifications (RFC8520) to a set of concrete tests, which can be verified systematically. 

To do this, we focused on clauses of RFC8520 that contain key terms implying mandatory directives, including ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', and optional choices such as ``MAY'' and ``MAY NOT''. 

As a result, we derived 26 verifiable tests; some are mandatory in nature, while others can be considered optional, depending on the key terms used in the corresponding clause of the RFC document.
