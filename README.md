# MUDConformanceTest
This repository hosts the Conformance Test Specifications for the MUD standard. This document maps the IETF MUD standard specifications (RFC8520) to a set of concrete tests that can be verified systematically. 

To do this, we focused on clauses of RFC8520 that contain key terms implying mandatory directives, including "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and optional choices such as "MAY" and "MAY NOT". 

As a result, we derived 26 verifiable tests; some are mandatory in nature, while others can be considered optional, depending on the key terms used in the corresponding clause of the RFC document.
